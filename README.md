Hi, hows it going?

My name is Kyle and I am learning how to program. Im currently in school for English Writing and plan on becoming an English Second Language teacher in Japan after I graduate. 
I am minoring in Linguistics and Japanese Language and Culture. I plan on taking the JLPT N3 before I graduate from NIU where I am attending school.
Some certification programs Im currently in include: TESOL, TEFL, Creative Writing, and CompTIA A+, Security+, CCNA classes. 
I am also working on growing a small business as well.

You may be wondering why I am doing so much--sometimes I wonder the same thing. I am very driven, goal oreinted, and I love to learn.
